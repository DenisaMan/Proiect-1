              <h2>Geralt of Rivia</h2>
              <p>
                Geralt of Rivia is a fictional character and the protagonist of
                The Witcher series of short stories and novels by Polish author
                Andrzej Sapkowski. He is a magically enhanced monster-hunter
                known as a "witcher", who possesses supernatural abilities due
                to his mutations.

                She is what is called a conduit, someone capable of harnessing
                the magical energy of the universe without undergoing any kind
                of modification. With due training, conduits of chaos are able
                to perform feats that surpass those of witchers by far, both in
                power level and complexity.
